## Components Description

N2W Converter is a simple .NET Web API that can convert dollar and cents in decimal values into words. There are 3 main impotant components in this project:

| **Component** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| **API**       | Web API project that contains endpoints that accept decimal values, convert them to words, and respond with the results. You can test this API using either `SwaggerUI` or the `demo.sh` script. |
| **API.Tests** | Unit tests for the `Convert` function to ensure all scenarios are handled. While not guaranteed to be bug-free, it aims to be nearly so. |
| **demo.sh**   | Interactive shell script to test the API. You can edit the base URL and port number here, and set `AllowRounding` to `True` or `False` (default is `False`). |

## Let's Talk About Algorithm

So, here‚Äôs the scoop on the algorithm I'm using. It might not be the fanciest or most mind-blowing formula you‚Äôll ever find online (like those that promise to solve world hunger with just a few lines of code), but it‚Äôs pretty solve the problem!

### Think of the Algorithm as a Digital Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Imagine you‚Äôre a digital wizard trying to turn boring old numbers into magical words. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® Instead of summoning mystical incantations, we‚Äôre using a bit of number-crunching logic that‚Äôs more like organizing your sock drawer!

### Breaking Down the Number üß©

Here‚Äôs the secret sauce:

1. **Identify the Stars:** Every decimal number can be splitted into 2 groups. First group, the "dollar" that can contain infinitely large number and second group, the "cent" which could not exceed 2 digits. For dollar part, it consist of three main elements: **Ones**, **Tens**, and **Hundreds** while the cent only contains **Ones** and **Tens**. Those elements can be viewed as below:
   - **Ones** the smallest member (1, 2, 3, etc.).
   - **Tens** are the two-digit pals (20, 30, 40, etc.).
   - **Hundreds** are the big shots (100, 200, 300, etc.).

2. **Divide and Conquer:** Just like slicing a pizza into slices, I split the number into these three parts using some string magic.
   - **String Indexing:** A fancy term for picking out parts of a number like a kid picking out their favorite candy. üç≠

3. **Create Word Objects:** I then turn these parts into words using a bit of digital craftiness.
   - **Ones ‚Üí "Three", "Seven"**
   - **Tens ‚Üí "Twenty", "Fifty"**
   - **Hundreds ‚Üí "One Hundred", "Two Hundred"**
   - **Illions ‚Üí "Thousands", "Millions", "Billions", "Trillions", "Quadrillions", ...** 
  
     *Firstly "Illions" is a new word I introduce here, you'ren't gonna find elsewhere and secondly, I purposely make it exceed trillions because, let‚Äôs be honest, ‚Çø value might keep going up forever, right! üöÄüí∞*
     
4. **Combine Words:** Next, I piece everything together into one beautiful, wordy masterpiece. Just like making a sandwich from the ingredients you have.

5. **Handle Special Cases:** Every good recipe has its quirks, like ‚Äúteens‚Äù (10-19) which are their own special club. üéâ

6. **Code It Up:** Finally, I code all this into a neat algorithm that takes a number and turns it into words!

7. **Extra Sauce**: I have optional parameter called `AllowRounding`. Set it to `false` if you don't want to allow more than 2 decimal points or `true` to round it up into just 2 decimal points.

### The Summary in a Nutshell

| **Step**                   | **What‚Äôs Happening?**                                                                                                  |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Be a Number Wizard**   | Converting numbers to words might not involve spells, but it does involve breaking things down and putting them back together! |
| **Find the Stars**       | Break down numbers into **Ones**, **Tens**, and **Hundreds** like sorting your LEGO pieces.                          |
| **Slice the Number**     | Use string manipulation like a digital chef to divide the number into components.                                    |
| **Create Word Objects**  | Convert those components into words, sort of like translating numbers into the language of the fairy tales.          |
| **Make a Word Sandwich**  | Combine those words to form the final, magical word representation of the number.                                     |
| **Handle Special Guests** | Deal with those tricky ‚Äúteen‚Äù numbers like a pro party host.                                                           |
| **Write the Code**       | Turn this fun process into code that does the magic for you!                                                            |

So, while my algorithm might not win any awards for elegance, it sure gets the job done in a fun and practical way. üèÜüéâ

    cd n2w-converter
    code .
    ```

3. **Open the API Project**

    In VS Code, open the `API` directory where the `.csproj` file is located. You can do this by either using the VS Code file explorer or the following command in the integrated terminal:

    ```sh
    cd API
    ```

4. **Restore Dependencies**

    Restore the .NET dependencies required for the project:

    dotnet build
    ```

6. **Run the API**

    Start the .NET Web API using the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    By default, the API will run on `http://localhost:5xxx`. You can verify the exact URL in the output of the `dotnet run` command.

7. **Test the API with Swagger**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5xxx/swagger` (or the respective URL based on the `dotnet run` output) to access the Swagger UI for API testing.

8. **Edit the Port Number**

    Update the port number in `n2w-converter/demo.sh` to match the port number specified in Step 6.

    ```sh
    # Line 5: local base_url=http://localhost:5052
    ```

9.  **Run the Demo Script**

    Open a new terminal window or tab and execute the demo script to run the API demo:

    ```sh
    ./demo.sh
    ```

#### Steps Summary

- **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/programmermelayu/n2w-converter.git`

## How to Run Unit Tests 

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.
- Make sure `API.Tests` exist in the solution directory

### Steps to Run Unit Tests

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**

   - On **Windows**, you can use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or the terminal integrated into Visual Studio Code.
   - On **macOS** or **Linux**, open the Terminal application.

2. **Navigate to `API.Tests` Directory**

   Change the directory to the root where the `.sln` file is located, or directly to the directory of the test project.

   ```sh
   cd n2w-converter
   ```

3. **Restore Dependencies**

   Ensure that all necessary packages are installed by running the `dotnet restore` command.

   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

   *Restores the NuGet packages required for the project.*

4. **Build the Solution**

   Compile the code to make sure there are no build errors.

   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

   *Builds the project and prepares it for testing.*

5. **Run the Tests**

   Execute the `dotnet test` command to run all the unit tests in the solution or test project.

   ```sh
   dotnet test
   ```

   *Runs all the unit tests and displays the test results in the terminal.*

6. **View the Test Results**

   After running `dotnet test`, you will see the results in the terminal, including which tests passed, failed, or were skipped.

   - **Green**: Tests passed.
   - **Red**: Tests failed.
   - **Yellow**: Tests were skipped.

   *Example output:*
   ```
   Test Run Successful.
   Total tests: 15
   Passed: 15
   Failed: 0
   Skipped: 0
   ```
8. **Generate Test Reports**

   You can generate test reports using the `--logger` option.

   ```sh
   dotnet test --logger "trx;LogFileName=test_results.trx"
   ```

   *Generates a `.trx` file with test results that can be viewed in Visual Studio or other tools.*

#### Steps Summary

- **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:** Use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal depending on your OS.
- **Navigate to Your Project Directory:** Change the directory to where the `.sln` file or test project is located.
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
- **Restore Dependencies:** Install necessary packages.
    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```
- **Build the Solution:** Compile the project.
    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```
- **Run the Tests:** Execute all unit tests.
    ```sh
    dotnet test
    ```
- **View the Test Results:** Check the terminal for test outcomes.
- **Generate Test Reports (Optional):** Create a `.trx` file with test results.
    ```sh
    dotnet test --logger "trx;LogFileName=test_results.trx"
    ```
