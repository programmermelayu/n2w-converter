## Components Description

N2W Converter is a simple .NET Web API that can convert dollar and cents in decimal values into words. There are 3 main impotant components in this project:

| **Component** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| **API**       | Web API project that contains endpoints that accept decimal values, convert them to words, and respond with the results. You can test this API using given `client`, `SwaggerUI` or the `demo.sh` script. |
| **client**   | Very simple client app developed using React, easy enough to get you started. |
| **API.Tests** | Unit tests for the `Convert` function to ensure all scenarios are handled. While not guaranteed to be bug-free, it aims to be nearly so. |
| **demo.sh**   | Interactive shell script to test the API. You can edit the base URL and port number here, and set `AllowRounding` to `True` or `False` (default is `False`). |

## Let's Talk About Algorithm

So, here‚Äôs the scoop on the algorithm I'm using. It might not be the fanciest or most mind-blowing formula you‚Äôll ever find online (like those that promise to solve world hunger with just a few lines of code), but it‚Äôs pretty solve the problem!

### Think of the Algorithm as a Digital Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Imagine you‚Äôre a digital wizard trying to turn boring old numbers into magical words. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® Instead of summoning mystical incantations, we‚Äôre using a bit of number-crunching logic that‚Äôs more like organizing your sock drawer!

### Breaking Down the Number üß©

Here‚Äôs the secret sauce:

1. **Identify the Stars:** Every decimal number can be splitted into 2 groups. First group, the "dollar" that can contain infinitely large number and second group, the "cent" which could not exceed 2 digits. For dollar part, it consist of three main elements: **Ones**, **Tens**, and **Hundreds** while the cent only contains **Ones** and **Tens**. Those elements can be viewed as below:
   - **Ones** the smallest member (1, 2, 3, etc.).
   - **Tens** are the two-digit pals (20, 30, 40, etc.).
   - **Hundreds** are the big shots (100, 200, 300, etc.).

2. **Divide and Conquer:** Just like slicing a pizza into slices, I split the number into these three parts using some string magic.
   - **String Indexing:** A fancy term for picking out parts of a number like a kid picking out their favorite candy. üç≠

3. **Create Word Objects:** I then turn these parts into words using a bit of digital craftiness.
   - **Ones ‚Üí "Three", "Seven"**
   - **Tens ‚Üí "Twenty", "Fifty"**
   - **Hundreds ‚Üí "One Hundred", "Two Hundred"**
   - **Illions ‚Üí "Thousands", "Millions", "Billions", "Trillions", "Quadrillions", ...** 
  
     *Firstly "Illions" is a new word I introduce here, you'ren't gonna find elsewhere and secondly, I purposely make it exceed trillions because, let‚Äôs be honest, ‚Çø value might keep going up forever, right! üöÄüí∞*
     
4. **Combine Words:** Next, I piece everything together into one beautiful, wordy masterpiece. Just like making a sandwich from the ingredients you have.

5. **Handle Special Cases:** Every good recipe has its quirks, like ‚Äúteens‚Äù (10-19) which are their own special club. üéâ

6. **Code It Up:** Finally, I code all this into a neat algorithm that takes a number and turns it into words!

7. **Extra Sauce**: I have optional parameter called `AllowRounding`. Set it to `false` if you don't want to allow more than 2 decimal points or `true` to round it up into just 2 decimal points.

### The Summary in a Nutshell

| **Step**                   | **What‚Äôs Happening?**                                                                                                  |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Be a Number Wizard**   | Converting numbers to words might not involve spells, but it does involve breaking things down and putting them back together! |
| **Find the Stars**       | Break down numbers into **Ones**, **Tens**, and **Hundreds** like sorting your LEGO pieces.                          |
| **Slice the Number**     | Use string manipulation like a digital chef to divide the number into components.                                    |
| **Create Word Objects**  | Convert those components into words, sort of like translating numbers into the language of the fairy tales.          |
| **Make a Word Sandwich**  | Combine those words to form the final, magical word representation of the number.                                     |
| **Handle Special Guests** | Deal with those tricky ‚Äúteen‚Äù numbers like a pro party host.                                                           |
| **Write the Code**       | Turn this fun process into code that does the magic for you!                                                            |

So, while my algorithm might not win any awards for elegance, it sure gets the job done in a fun and practical way. üèÜüéâ
